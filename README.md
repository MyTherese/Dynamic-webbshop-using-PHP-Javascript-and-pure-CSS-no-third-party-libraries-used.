# Webshop-in-PHP-javascript-and-pure-css-no-third-parties.



Simple webbshop for concert tickets, using php getting data from mysql database and javascript. 
    Styling is pure CSS for mobile and desktop format. 
    No third-partie libaries in use because of training exercise.

- Registration and log in with php and Mysql database
    Basic and weak security validation is used due to learning exercise.
    Next step is to use password hashing.

- Payment with php and Mysql database
    Simple cart form width coupon code validation.
    Next step is to create a payment part with confirmation and validation with suitable paymentmethod like paypal.
    Then when payment is confirmed cupon is marked as used. 

Reflections of methods.
Localstorage: I chose localstorage dispite the limited storage kapacity mostely because of training and understanding client side storage.
