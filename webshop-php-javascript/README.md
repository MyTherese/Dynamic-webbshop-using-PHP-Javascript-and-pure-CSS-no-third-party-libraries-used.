# webshop-php-javascript

Simple webbshop for concert tickets, using php getting data from database mysql and javascript. Styling is pure CSS. 
No third-party libaries in use because of training exercise.

Reflections of methods.

Localstorage: I chose localstorage mostely because of training and understanding of client side storage, dispite the limited storage kapacity.


To clone use local web-server.

Not using webpackage for this one.
