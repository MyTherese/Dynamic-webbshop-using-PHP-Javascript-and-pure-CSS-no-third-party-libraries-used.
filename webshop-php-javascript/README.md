To clone use local web-server.
Not using webpackage for this one.

Note: this is a beginner project!
Simple webbshop for concert tickets, using php getting data from database mysql and javascript. Styling is pure CSS for mobile and desktop format. 
No third-party libaries in use because of training exercise.

Registration and log in with php and Mysql database
Basic and weak security validation is used due to learning exercise.
Next step is to use password hashing.


Payment with php and Mysql database
Simple cart form width coupon code validation.
Next step is to create a payment part with confirmation and validation with suitable paymentmethod like paypal.
Then when payment is confirmed cupon is marked as used. 

Reflections of methods.
Localstorage: I chose localstorage dispite the limited storage kapacity mostely because of training and understanding client side storage.
